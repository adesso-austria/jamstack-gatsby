        He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like
        text that wasn’t captured. You could see there was text coming out of
        her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. I know words. I have the best
        words. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it.
        You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder
        you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. Look at that
        text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next
        webpage?! All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me -
        consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected. I think the only
        difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more
        honest and my words are more beautiful. Look at that text! Would anyone
        use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! I'm
        speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and
        I've said a lot of things. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower
        Grill. I love Hispanics! I was going to say something extremely rough to
        Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just
        can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." Lorem Ipsum is the
        single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other
        websites. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love
        Hispanics! An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told
        me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.
